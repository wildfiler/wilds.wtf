## Various game dev stuff

'm not game developer, but why not?..  

Mainly I'm playing with [DragonRuby Game Toolkit](https://dragonruby.org/toolkit/game), because I love ruby and this is the easiest way to play with graphics in cross-platform way. 

## DragonRuby stuff

Some experiments with DragonRuby GTK. Successful and not.  

### Libs

- [DRTiled](https://github.com/wildfiler/drtiled) - library for importing TMX files made by Tiled map editor.
- [Penguins on Dragons](https://github.com/wildfiler/pinguins-on-dragon) - Prototype of a library for _easy_ game creation.

### Games


- [Cat walk](https://wildfiler.itch.io/cat-walk) - First attempt in making something.
- [Fishercat 3310](https://wildfiler.itch.io/fishercat-3310) - Game for [NOKIA 3310 JAM 3](https://itch.io/jam/nokiajam3).
- [DRIslands](https://wildfiler.itch.io/drislands) - Trying to use my own libraries for developing simple top-down game.

### Algorithms

- [Experiment](https://wildfiler.itch.io/multiagents-multitargets) with flow fields for multiagent multitarget pathfinding.
